You can disenchant RimCards to get RimCard Dust using the Disenchanting RimCard Table.
You can craft RimCards with dust and other ingredients (depending on the card) using the Crafting Rimcard Table.
You can buy them from a dedicated RimCards Trader.
All RimCards exist in a Shiny Version that cost more to buy from the RimCards Trader.
